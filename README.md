# My-First-Pygame

This Python code implements a game called "SlapFace" using the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a hand character with arrow keys to slap a character named "Zijet" while avoiding another character named "Teacher". The game window is set to 800x600 pixels with a wooden floor background. The player earns points for hitting "Zijet" and loses points for hitting "Teacher". The game ends when the player reaches a score of 15, displaying a "Game Over" message. Audio cues and text instructions provide feedback to the player throughout the game.
